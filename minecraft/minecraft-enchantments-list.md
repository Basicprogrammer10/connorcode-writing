# List of Minecraft Enchantments

I was recently making a villager trading hall in minecraft and wanted a nice way to track the enchantments I got and need to get.
I searched around a bit but didn't find what I was looking for and I had to settle for using ms paint to cross of items from a screenshot.

Info

This was last updated for Minecraft [1.20.1](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Java_Edition_1.20.1).
There may or may not be new enchantments that are not on this list.
