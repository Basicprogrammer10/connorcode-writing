# ðŸŽ» Jukebox Plugin

Have you ever wanted to play midi remakes of your favorite songs through Minecraft?
Well I certainly haven't but I'm going to do it anyway.

I made a bukkit plugin to read [Note block Studio] files and use a nice in game UI to let players pick songs to be played.
It then sends packets to all the players to have their clients play note block sounds.

## The UI

## Loading the songs

### Converting songs

## Playing music

## Conclusion
