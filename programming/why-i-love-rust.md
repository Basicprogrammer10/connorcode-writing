# ðŸ¦€ Why I Love Rust

On the [2021 Stack Overflow Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021) Rust is the **most loved** language.
This is the 6th year rust had been voted most loved. People definitely love Rust, but why?
In this article I will explain why **I** like rust, and at the end I will touch on some improvements it needs.

## âœ¨ Why It's Great

Here I will show some amazing parts of rust!

### ðŸš„ Speed

First off lets touch on the speed of the language.
It is a compiled language, so it gets similar speed to the C family of languages.
According to tests at [The Benchmarks Game](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/fastest/rust-clang.html) Rust often out preformed `C Clang` a or was very close.

Here are the first three tests

### ðŸ“– Documentation

Rust has great Documentation in two ways.

The **first way** is Actual Documentation, when you are getting started with rust there is [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/).
It teaches the important concepts of rust, going from printing `"Hello World"` to making a webserver.
The [Standard Library](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/) is very well documented with clear information and lots of examples.

The **second way** is with [Rust Doc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/index.html), which is a program to generate Documentation pages from Doc comments on Functions, Structs, Enums, etc.
These doc comments support Markdown, including Code Blocks that are actually tested like unit tests.

> Its job is to generate documentation for Rust projects.
> On a fundamental level, Rustdoc takes as an argument either a crate root or a Markdown file, and produces HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
>
> â€” [The Rust Doc Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/index.html)

For example if I have the following function:

````rust
/// Used to Greet Someone
///
/// ## Example
/// ```rust
/// greet("Darren");
/// ```
pub fn greet(name: &str) {
  println!("Hello {name}!");
}
````

I can build and open the docs with this command

```bash
cargo doc --open
```

Here we can see the final output of the documentation
