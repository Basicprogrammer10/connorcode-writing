# 🦀 Why I Love Rust

On the [2021 Stack Overflow Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021) Rust is the **most loved** language.
This is the 6th year rust had been voted most loved. People definitely love Rust, but why?
In this article I will explain why **I** like rust, and at the end I will touch on some improvements it needs.

## ✨ Why It's Great

Here I will show some amazing parts of rust!

### 🚄 Speed

First off lets touch on the speed of the language.
It is a compiled language, so it gets similar speed to the C family of languages.
According to tests at [The Benchmarks Game](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/fastest/rust-clang.html) Rust often out preformed `C Clang` a or was very close.

Here are the first three tests

### 📖 Documentation

Rust has great Documentation in two ways.

The **first way** is Actual Documentation, when you are getting started with rust there is [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/).
It teaches the important concepts of rust, going from printing `"Hello World"` to making a webserver.
The [Standard Library](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/) is also very well documented with clear information and lots of examples.

The **second way** is with [Rust Doc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/index.html), which is a program to generate Documentation pages from Doc comments on Functions, Structs, Enums, etc.
These doc comments support Markdown, including Code Blocks that are actually tested like unit tests.

> Its job is to generate documentation for Rust projects.
> On a fundamental level, Rustdoc takes as an argument either a crate root or a Markdown file, and produces HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
>
> — [The Rust Doc Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/index.html)

For example if I have the following function:

````rust
/// Used to Greet Someone
///
/// ## Example
/// ```rust
/// greet("Darren");
/// ```
pub fn greet(name: &str) {
  println!("Hello {name}!");
}
````

I can build and open the docs with this command

```bash
cargo doc --open
```

Here we can see the final output of the documentation

## 📦 Cargo

This is a big one!

> Cargo is the Rust package manager.
> Cargo downloads your Rust package's dependencies, compiles your packages, makes distributable packages, and uploads them to crates.io, the Rust community’s package registry.
>
> — [Cargo Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/)

Basically it makes creating, building, running, testing, documenting and benchmarking easier.
So you can use Cargo to easily use other libraries with your programs.
But Cargo is much more…

Cargo can make use of other programs like [Rust FMT](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt) for code formatting and
[Rust Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) for catching common mistakes in your code.
You can even add your own sub commands to Cargo.

### 🧁 Rust FMT

Let's say we have the following code to normalize an HTTP path (from [afire](https://github.com/Basicprogrammer10/afire)).
(_yes,,, i had to make this messy lol_)

```rust
fn normalize_path(mut path:String) -> String {
  if path.ends_with ( '/' )
  {      path.pop();
  }

      if !path.starts_with('/') {
            path.insert(0, '/');

      }

    path
      }
```

By running Rust FMT (`cargo fmt`) our messy code will be made into the following

```rust
fn normalize_path(mut path: String) -> String {
    if path.ends_with('/') {
        path.pop();
    }

    if !path.starts_with('/') {
        path.insert(0, '/');
    }

    path
}
```

You can see how It fixed the indentation, spacing, and extra new lines.
As great is it is we sometimes want to keep specific formatting, for that you can use `#[rustfmt::skip]` attribute.
Personally I have my text editor format the file on save.

### ✂ Cargo Clippy

[Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) has over 500 [lints](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html) to catch common mistakes and improve your Rust code.

Like before lets look at an example. I tried to cram a lot of problems into this :P.
At first glance it may look like it works, when running it does give a correct looking response for the circumference.

```rust
let mut e = 3.14;
let mut pi = 2.71;

// Swap `e` and `pi`
pi = e;
e = pi;

// Calculate circumference
let circumference = 2.0 * pi * 10.0;

// Print Results
println!("PI: {pi}");
println!("E: {e}");
println!("Circumference: {circumference}");

assert!(true)
```

Let's now run Rust Clippy (`cargo clippy`).

```
warning: value assigned to `pi` is never read
 --> src/main.rs:3:13
  |
3 |     let mut pi = 2.71;
  |             ^^
  |

  = help: maybe it is overwritten before being read?

  = help: consider using the constant directly

   = help: remove it
   = help: for further information visit https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#assertions_on_constants

warning: `playground` (bin "playground") generated 2 warnings
error: could not compile `playground` due to 2 previous errors; 2 warnings emitted
```

Ok,,, you gotta admit it's a little impressive to put that many issues in so little code.
Anyway it not only shows what the issue is, but it will often show how to fix it.
Using these errors and suggestions our code becomes the following

```rust
let mut e = std::f32::consts::PI;
let mut pi = std::f32::consts::E;

std::mem::swap(&mut pi, &mut e);

let circumference = 2.0 * pi * 10.0;

println!("PI: {pi}");
println!("E: {e}");
println!("Circumference: {circumference}");
```

## 🐡 TurboFish

This is a smaller feature bit frequently comes in handy.
TurboFish as it is typically called is a way of passing a type to a function that returns a Generic.
It is needed when the compiler cant infer the type.
It is much cleaner than having to assign the value to a variable with an explicit type if you are going to use it again after.

Here is an example

```rust
let x = vec![2, 4, 6, 8];
let y = x.iter().map(|x| x * 2).collect().len();

assert_eq!(y, 4);
```

When trying to compile this we get this error

```
error[E0282]: type annotations needed
 --> src/main.rs:4:37
  |
  |     let y = x.iter().map(|x| x * 2).collect().len();
  |                                     ^^^^^^^ cannot infer type for type parameter `B` declared on the associated function `collect`
  |
  = note: type must be known at this point
```

If we were to add the type `usize` to the variable definition this would not help, as the type is needed before then.
To fix this we could remove the `.len()` and add the type `Vec<_>` to the variable `y` and redefine it later, but this is messy.
With turbo fish this can be fixed by changing line `2` to the following

```rust
let y = x.iter().map(|x| x * 2).collect::<Vec<_>>().len();
```

The underscore tells the compiler to infer the type. In this case it just needed to know that we were collecting into a Vector.
Now it compiles and runs perfectly. _Cool Beans_!
