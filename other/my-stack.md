# ðŸ“œ My Stack

Tools and extensions I use for creating Websites and other Programs.

The <i class="fa fa-code"></i> icon specifies _Open Source_ software.

## Tools

#### Atom <sup><i class="fa fa-code"></i></sup>

<img src="../assets/other/my-stack/atom.png" width="150"></img>

[Atom](https://atom.io/) is the text editor _for the 21st Century_.
I use it for almost all of my text editing needs.
The startup time may be a bit slow as it is an election app but one it starts it's more than fast enough.
The advanced configuration is super easy because you can just style the UI with CSS.
I use the following community packages as well

- [ide-rust](https://atom.io/packages/ide-rust)
- [atom-beautify](https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify)
- [linter-eslist](https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify)
- [logo-file-icons](https://atom.io/packages/logo-file-icons)
- [minimap](https://atom.io/packages/minimap)
- [prettier-atom](https://atom.io/packages/prettier-atom)
- [pigments](https://atom.io/packages/pigments)

#### Insomnia <sup><i class="fa fa-code"></i></sup>

[Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) is a spectacular HTTP client for testing APIs.
It has support for REST, SOAP, GraphQL, and GRPC.
It has been a crucial part of development for this website and [afire](https://crates.io/crates/afire) my dependency free rust web server framework.

#### Alacritty <sup><i class="fa fa-code"></i></sup>

<img src="../assets/other/my-stack/alacritty.png" width="150"></img>

[Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) is an incredibly performant hardware accelerated terminal emulator.
It's also written in rust, so it may get some bonus points :P

#### Firefox <sup><i class="fa fa-code"></i></sup>

[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) is my prefered browser for multiple reasons.
